I appreciate any contribution to this project to make It better, in order to contribute I’ve set up couple of ways.

# Bugs

If you’ve found a bug within the application you may open an issue by using the issue template that has been provided,

- Open an issue
- Provide all the useful information
- Would be wonderful if the provided videos will be in MP4 only.

If the issue is duplicated it will be closed straight away in order to reduce clutter and get the right things fixed

The issue ticket will be closed upon the fix has been implemented.

# Feature/Request

You may open an issue with adding –[Feature] to the title, there’s already a template for features.

- Requested features will go under review by the developers and if approved the feature will be implemented if not the issue will be closed, and the feature will be declined for the meanwhile.

- Duplicates will be removed.
