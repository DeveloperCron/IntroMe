## Motivation

While there are many ways to create an intro for your presentations, it can be challenging to find simple and effective tools to do so. That's where our new tool comes in, inspired by the popular video conferencing platform Webex. With our tool, you can easily create a sleek and professional intro screen that will capture your audience's attention from the very beginning of your presentation. Say goodbye to the hassle of designing your own intro screen and hello to a seamless and polished presentation experience.
